<p>A  car  rental   or car hire agency is a company that rents automobiles for short periods of time  for a fee.It is an elaborate form of a rental shop,often  organized with numerous local branches (which allow a user to returna vehicle to a different location), and primarily located near airports or busy,city areas and often complemented by awebsite allowing online eservations.Car rental agencies primarily serve people who have a car that is temporarily out of reach or out of service, for example travellers who are out of town or owners of damaged or destroyed vehicles who are awaiting repair or insurance compensation. Because of the variety of sizes of their vehicles, car rental agencies may also  serve the self-moving industry needs, by renting vans or trucks, and in certain markets other types of vehicles such as motorcycles or  scooters may also be offered. A typical car rental agency offers average-priced vehicles, however some facilities may offer higher-end models of a particular manufacturer, such as Lincoln Town Car or Cadillac DTS in the US. Some may also offer vehicles like Jaguar or Mustang  to attract a specialty market. Most also offer SUVs  in addition to passenger vans. At major airports or in larger cities, some independent  car rental agencies offer ultra high-end vehicles for rent. These models can include Mercedes Benz, Porsche, Ferrari, and even Rolls Royce.  This market is usually too cost prohibitive and unnecessary for the average car renter. Rent-a-Wreck got started by offering older vehicles at reduced prices.</p>
